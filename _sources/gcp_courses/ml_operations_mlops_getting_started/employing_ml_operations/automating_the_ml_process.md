In any **ML project**, after you define the **business use case** and establish the **success criteria**, the process of delivering an **ML model** to **production** involves many steps. 

These include: 
* **Data extraction**, 
* **Data analysis**, 
* **Data preparation** 
* **Model training** 
* **Model evaluation** 
* **Model validation** 
* **Model serving** and 
* **Model monitoring** 

These steps can be completed manually or by an **automatic pipeline**.

The level of automation of these steps defines the maturity of the **ML process**.

Many **ML professionals** build and **deploy** their models manually. 
This is called maturity level 0. 

Other **ML practitioners** perform **continuous training** of their **models** by **automating the ML pipeline**. This is maturity level 1.

Finally, the most mature approach completely automates and integrates the **ML training**, **validation**, and **deployment phases**. This is maturity level 2. 

Letâ€™s look at each of these levels of automation in a little more detail.

At the basic level of maturity, or level 0, many teams have **data scientists** and **ML researchers** who can build **state-of-the-art models**, but their process for building and deploying **ML models** is entirely manual. 

The characteristics of **MLOps level 0** are: 

* A manual, script-driven, and interactive process. 
* A disconnection between `ML` and **operation teams**. 
* Infrequent release iterations. 
* No **continuous integration**, **continuous delivery** or **continuous deployment**. **Deployment** refers to the **prediction service**. 
* And a lack of **active performance monitoring**. 

Check the documentation to learn more about the characteristics and challenges of **MLOps level 0**.

The goal of **MLOps level 1** is to perform **continuous training of the model by automating the ML pipeline**. 

This lets you achieve the **continuous delivery of the model prediction service**. 

To automate the process of using **new data to retrain models in production**, you must introduce **automated data and model validation steps to the pipeline**, as well as **pipeline triggers and metadata management**. 

The characteristics of **MLOps level 1** are: 
* Rapid experiment 
* **Continuous training of the model in production** 
* Experimental-operational symmetry 
* Modularized code for components and pipelines 
* **Continuous deployment of models**, which means **continuous delivery of models and automated pipeline deployment**.  

One important note is that to enable **ML continuous training**, you must to add a couple of the components, such as **data and model validation, feature store, metadata management, and ML pipeline triggers to the architecture**.

**MLOps level 2** can be characterized as **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**, or **CI/CD**, **pipeline automation**, because you need a robust **automated CI/CD system** for a rapid and reliable update of the **pipelines in production**. 

This automated **CI/CD system** lets **ML practitioners** rapidly explore new ideas around **feature engineering**, **model architecture**, and **hyperparameters**. 

**MLOps level 2** achieves this automation thanks to the following components: 
* Source control 
* Test and build services 
* **Deployment services** 
* Model registry 
* Feature store 
* ML metadata store 
* ML pipeline orchestrator.

In any **ML project**, after you define the **business use case** and establish the **success criteria**, the process of delivering an **ML model to production** involves many steps.

These include: 

**Development and experimentation**: you iteratively test **new ML algorithms** and **new modeling** where **the experiment steps are orchestrated**. 

The output of this stage is the source code of the **ML pipeline steps** that are then pushed to a source repository. 

Then, **pipeline continuous integration**: you build source code and run various tests. 

The outputs of this stage are **pipeline components** such as packages, executables, and artifacts that are deployed in a later stage. 

Next is **pipeline continuous delivery**: you deploy the artifacts produced by the **CI stage** to the target environment. 

The output of this stage is a **deployed pipeline** with the new implementation of the **model**.

Then there is **automated triggering**: the **pipeline** is automatically executed in **production** based on a schedule or in response to a trigger. 

The output of this stage is a **trained model** that is pushed to the **model registry**.

The next is **model continuous delivery**: you **serve** the **trained model** as a **prediction service** for the **predictions**. 

The output of this stage is a **deployed model prediction service**. 

And finally, **monitoring**: you collect **statistics** on the **model performance** based on **live data**.

The output of this stage is a trigger to execute the pipeline or to execute a new experiment cycle. 

These steps can be completed manually or by an **automatic pipeline**.
