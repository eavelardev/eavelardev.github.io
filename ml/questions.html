                      You are developing a proof of concept for a real-time fraud detection model. After undersampling the training set to achieve a 50% fraud rate, you train and tune a tree classifier using area under the curve (AUC) as the metric, and then calibrate the model. You need to share metrics that represent your model’s effectiveness with business stakeholders in a way that is easily interpreted. Which approach should you take?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Calculate the AUC on the holdout dataset at a classification threshold of 0.5, and report true positive rate, false positive rate, and false negative rate.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      You need business directions about the cost of misclassification to define the optimal threshold for both balanced and imbalanced classification.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Undersample the minority class to achieve a 50% fraud rate in the holdout set. Plot the confusion matrix at a classification threshold of 0.5, and report precision and recall.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      The holdout dataset needs to represent real-world transactions to have a meaningful model evaluation, and you should never change its distribution.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Select all transactions in the holdout dataset. Plot the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC), and report the F1 score for all available thresholds.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Classes in the holdout dataset are not balanced, so the ROC curve is not appropriate; also, neither F1 score nor ROC curve is recommended for communicating to business stakeholders. The F1 score aggregates precision and recall, but it is important to look at each metric separately to evaluate the model’s performance when the cost of misclassification is highly unbalanced between labels.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      Select all transactions in the holdout dataset. Plot the precision-recall curve with associated average precision, and report the true positive rate, false positive rate, and false negative rate for all available thresholds.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      The precision-recall curve is an appropriate metric for imbalanced classification when the output can be set using different thresholds. Presenting the precision-recall curve together with the mentioned rates provides business stakeholders with all the information necessary to evaluate model performance.

                      Your organization’s marketing team wants to send biweekly scheduled emails to customers that are expected to spend above a variable threshold. This is the first machine learning (ML) use case for the marketing team, and you have been tasked with the implementation. After setting up a new Google Cloud project, you use Vertex AI Workbench to develop model training and batch inference with an XGBoost model on the transactional data stored in Cloud Storage. You want to automate the end-to-end pipeline that will securely provide the predictions to the marketing team, while minimizing cost and code maintenance. What should you do?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      Create a scheduled pipeline on Vertex AI Pipelines that accesses the data from Cloud Storage, uses Vertex AI to perform training and batch prediction, and outputs a file in a Cloud Storage bucket that contains a list of all customer emails and expected spending.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Vertex AI Pipelines and Cloud Storage are cost-effective and secure solutions. The solution requires the least number of code interactions because the marketing team can update the pipeline and schedule parameters from the Google Cloud console.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Create a scheduled pipeline on Cloud Composer that accesses the data from Cloud Storage, copies the data to BigQuery, uses BigQuery ML to perform training and batch prediction, and outputs a table in BigQuery with customer emails and expected spending.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Cloud Composer is not a cost-efficient solution for one pipeline because its environment is always active. In addition, using BigQuery is not the most cost-effective solution.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Create a scheduled notebook on Vertex AI Workbench that accesses the data from Cloud Storage, performs training and batch prediction on the managed notebook instance, and outputs a file in a Cloud Storage bucket that contains a list of all customer emails and expected spending.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      The marketing team would have to enter the Vertex AI Workbench instance to update a pipeline parameter, which does not minimize code interactions.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Create a scheduled pipeline on Cloud Composer that accesses the data from Cloud Storage, uses Vertex AI to perform training and batch prediction, and sends an email to the marketing team’s Gmail group email with an attachment that contains an encrypted list of all customer emails and expected spending.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Cloud Composer is not a cost-efficient solution for one pipeline because its environment is always active. Also, using email to send personally identifiable information (PII) is not a recommended approach.

                    <div>
                      You have developed a very large network in TensorFlow Keras that is expected to train for multiple days. The model uses only built-in TensorFlow operations to perform training with high-precision arithmetic. You want to update the code to run distributed training using tf.distribute.Strategy and configure a corresponding machine instance in Compute Engine to minimize training time. What should you do?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Select an instance with an attached GPU, and gradually scale up the machine type until the optimal execution time is reached. Add MirroredStrategy to the code, and create the model in the strategy’s scope with batch size dependent on the number of replicas.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      It is suboptimal in minimizing execution time for model training. MirroredStrategy only supports multiple GPUs on one instance, which may not be as performant as running on multiple instances.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      Create an instance group with one instance with attached GPU, and gradually scale up the machine type until the optimal execution time is reached. Add TF_CONFIG and MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy to the code, create the model in the strategy’s scope, and set up data autosharding.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      GPUs are the correct hardware for deep learning training with high-precision training, and distributing training with multiple instances will allow maximum flexibility in fine-tuning the accelerator selection to minimize execution time. Note that one worker could still be the best setting if the overhead of synchronizing the gradients across machines is too high, in which case this approach will be equivalent to MirroredStrategy.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Create a TPU virtual machine, and gradually scale up the machine type until the optimal execution time is reached. Add TPU initialization at the start of the program, define a distributed TPUStrategy, and create the model in the strategy’s scope with batch size and training steps dependent on the number of TPUs.
                    </div>
                    <div>

                      Create a TPU node, and gradually scale up the machine type until the optimal execution time is reached. Add TPU initialization at the start of the program, define a distributed TPUStrategy, and create the model in the strategy’s scope with batch size and training steps dependent on the number of TPUs.

                      You developed a tree model based on an extensive feature set of user behavioral data. The model has been in production for 6 months. New regulations were just introduced that require anonymizing personally identifiable information (PII), which you have identified in your feature set using the Cloud Data Loss Prevention API. You want to update your model pipeline to adhere to the new regulations while minimizing a reduction in model performance. What should you do?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Redact the features containing PII data, and train the model from scratch.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Removing features from the model does not keep referential integrity by maintaining the original relationship between records, and is likely to cause a drop in performance.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Mask the features containing PII data, and tune the model from the last checkpoint.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Masking does not enforce referential integrity, and a drop in model performance may happen. Also, tuning the existing model is not recommended because the model training on the original dataset may have memorized sensitive information.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      Use key-based hashes to tokenize the features containing PII data, and train the model from scratch.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Hashing is an irreversible transformation that ensures anonymization and does not lead to an expected drop in model performance because you keep the same feature set while enforcing referential integrity.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Use deterministic encryption to tokenize the features containing PII data, and tune the model from the last checkpoint.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Deterministic encryption is reversible, and anonymization requires irreversibility. Also, tuning the existing model is not recommended because the model training on the original dataset may have memorized sensitive information.

                      You set up a Vertex AI Workbench instance with a TensorFlow Enterprise environment to perform exploratory data analysis for a new use case. Your training and evaluation datasets are stored in multiple partitioned CSV files in Cloud Storage. You want to use TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV) to explore problems in your data before model tuning. You want to fix these problems as quickly as possible. What should you do?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      1. Use TFDV to generate statistics, and use Pandas to infer the schema for the training dataset that has been loaded from Cloud Storage.<br>2. Visualize both statistics and schema, and manually fix anomalies in the dataset’s schema and values.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      You also need to use the evaluation dataset for analysis. If the features do not belong to approximately the same range as the training dataset, the accuracy of the model will be affected.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                    <div>
                      1. Use TFDV to generate statistics and infer the schema for the training and evaluation datasets that have been loaded from Cloud Storage by using URI.<br>2. Visualize statistics for both datasets simultaneously to fix the datasets’ values, and fix the training dataset’s schema after displaying it together with anomalies in the evaluation dataset.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      It takes the minimum number of steps to correctly fix problems in the data with TFDV before model tuning. This process involves installing tensorflow_data_validation, loading the training and evaluation datasets directly from Cloud Storage, and fixing schema and values for both. Note that the schema is only stored for the training set because it is expected to match at evaluation.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      1. Use TFDV to generate statistics, and use Pandas to infer the schema for the training dataset that has been loaded from Cloud Storage.<br>2. Use TFRecordWriter to convert the training dataset into a TFRecord.<br>3. Visualize both statistics and schema, and manually fix anomalies in the dataset’s schema and values.

                    <div>
                      Transforming into TFRecord is an unnecessary step. Also, you need to use the evaluation dataset for analysis. If the features do not belong to approximately the same range as the training dataset, the accuracy of the model will be affected.

                      You have developed a simple feedforward network on a very wide dataset. You trained the model with mini-batch gradient descent and L1 regularization. During training, you noticed the loss steadily decreasing before moving back to the top at a very sharp angle and starting to oscillate. You want to fix this behavior with minimal changes to the model. What should you do?
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      Shuffle the data before training, and iteratively adjust the batch size until the loss improves.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      divergence due to repetitive behavior in the data typically shows a loss that starts oscillating after some steps but does not jump back to the top.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      Explore the feature set to remove NaNs and clip any noisy outliers. Shuffle the data before retraining.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      A large increase in loss is typically caused by anomalous values in the input data that cause NaN traps or exploding gradients.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                    <div>
                      Switch from L1 to L2 regularization, and iteratively adjust the L2 penalty until the loss improves.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      L2 is not clearly a better solution than L1 regularization for wide models. L1 helps with sparsity, and L2 helps with collinearity.

                      Adjust the learning rate to exponentially decay with a larger decrease at the step where the loss jumped, and iteratively adjust the initial learning rate until the loss improves.

                    <div>
                      A learning rate schedule that is not tuned typically shows a loss that starts oscillating after some steps but does not jump back to the top.

                      You trained a neural network on a small normalized wide dataset. The model performs well without overfitting, but you want to improve how the model pipeline processes the features because they are not all expected to be relevant for the prediction. You want to implement changes that minimize model complexity while maintaining or improving the model’s offline performance. What should you do?

                      Keep the original feature set, and add L1 regularization to the loss function.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Although the approach lets you reduce RAM requirements by pushing the weights for meaningless features to 0, regularization tends to cause the training error to increase. Consequently, the model performance is expected to decrease.

                      Use principal component analysis (PCA), and select the first n components that explain 99% of the variance.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      PCA is an unsupervised approach, and it is a valid method of feature selection only if the most important variables are the ones that also have the most variation. This is usually not true, and disregarding the last few components is likely to decrease model performance.
                    </div>

                      Perform correlation analysis. Remove features that are highly correlated to one another and features that are not correlated to the target.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Removing irrelevant features reduces model complexity and is expected to boost performance by removing noise.

                    <div>
                      Ensure that categorical features are one-hot encoded and that continuous variables are binned, and create feature crosses for a subset of relevant features.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      This approach can make the model converge faster but it increases model RAM requirements, and it is not expected to boost model performance because neural networks inherently learn feature crosses.

                      You trained a model in a Vertex AI Workbench notebook that has good validation RMSE. You defined 20 parameters with the associated search spaces that you plan to use for model tuning. You want to use a tuning approach that maximizes tuning job speed. You also want to optimize cost, reproducibility, model performance, and scalability where possible if they do not affect speed. What should you do?
                    </div>

                      Set up a cell to run a hyperparameter tuning job using Vertex AI Vizier with val_rmse specified as the metric in the study configuration.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Vertex AI Vizier should be used for systems that do not have a known objective function or are too costly to evaluate using the objective function. Neither applies to the specified use case. Vizier requires sequential trials and does not optimize for cost or tuning time.

                  </div>
                  <div>

                      Using a dedicated Python library such as Hyperopt or Optuna, configure a cell to run a local hyperparameter tuning job with Bayesian optimization.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Bayesian optimization can converge in fewer iterations than the other algorithms but not necessarily in a faster time because trials are dependent and thus require sequentiality. Also, running tuning locally does not optimize for reproducibility and scalability.

                      Refactor the notebook into a parametrized and dockerized Python script, and push it to Container Registry. Use the UI to set up a hyperparameter tuning job in Vertex AI. Use the created image and include Grid Search as an algorithm.

                    <div>
                      Grid Search is a brute-force approach and it is not feasible to fully parallelize. Because you need to try all hyperparameter combinations, that is an exponential number of trials with respect to the number of hyperparameters, Grid Search is inefficient for high spaces in time, cost, and computing power.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                      Random Search can limit the search iterations on time and parallelize all trials so that the execution time of the tuning job corresponds to the longest training produced by your hyperparameter combination. This approach also optimizes for the other mentioned metrics.

                      You trained a deep model for a regression task. The model predicts the expected sale price for a house based on features that are not guaranteed to be independent. You want to evaluate your model by defining a baseline approach and selecting an evaluation metric for comparison that detects high variance in the model. What should you do?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Use a heuristic that predicts the mean value as the baseline, and compare the trained model’s mean absolute error against the baseline.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Always predicting the mean value is not expected to be a strong baseline; house prices could assume a wide range of values. Also, mean absolute error is not the best metric to detect variance because it gives the same weight to all errors.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Use a linear model trained on the most predictive features as the baseline, and compare the trained model’s root mean squared error against the baseline.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      A linear model is not expected to perform well with multicollinearity. Also, root mean squared error does not penalize high variance as much as mean squared error because the root operation reduces the importance of higher values.

                    <div>
                      Determine the maximum acceptable mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as the baseline, and compare the model’s MAPE against the baseline.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      While defining a threshold for acceptable performance is a good practice for blessing models, a baseline should aim to test statistically a model’s ability to learn by comparing it to a less complex data-driven approach. Also, this approach does not detect high variance in the model.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      Use a simple neural network with one fully connected hidden layer as the baseline, and compare the trained model’s mean squared error against the baseline.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      A one-layer neural network can handle collinearity and is a good baseline. The mean square error is a good metric because it gives more weight to errors with larger absolute values than to errors with smaller absolute values.

                      You designed a 5-billion-parameter language model in TensorFlow Keras that used autotuned tf.data to load the data in memory. You created a distributed training job in Vertex AI with tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy, and set the large_model_v100 machine for the primary instance. The training job fails with the following error:<br>“The replica 0 ran out of memory with a non-zero status of 9.”<br>You want to fix this error without vertically increasing the memory of the replicas. What should you do?

                    <div>
                      MirroredStrategy is a data-parallel approach. This approach is not expected to fix the error because the memory issues in the primary replica are caused by the size of the model itself.

                    <div>
                      The parameter server alleviates some workload from the primary replica by coordinating the shared model state between the workers, but it still requires the whole model to be shared with workers. This approach is not expected to fix the error because the memory issues in the primary replica are caused by the size of the model itself.

                      This is an example of a model-parallel approach that splits the model between workers. You can use DTensors to implement this. This approach is expected to fix the error because the memory issues in the primary replica are caused by the size of the model itself.

                      You need to develop an online model prediction service that accesses pre-computed near-real-time features and returns a customer churn probability value.

                      You are logged into the Vertex AI Pipeline UI and noticed that an automated production TensorFlow training pipeline finished three hours earlier than a typical run. You do not have access to production data for security reasons, but you have verified that no alert was logged in any of the ML system’s monitoring systems and that the pipeline code has not been updated recently. You want to debug the pipeline as quickly as possible so you can determine whether to deploy the trained model. What should you do?
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      Navigate to Vertex AI Pipelines, and open Vertex AI TensorBoard. Check whether the training regime and metrics converge.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      TensorBoard provides a compact and complete overview of training metrics such as loss and accuracy over time. If the training converges with the model’s expected accuracy, the model can be deployed.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                    <div>
                      Access the Pipeline run analysis pane from Vertex AI Pipelines, and check whether the input configuration and pipeline steps have the expected values.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Checking input configuration is a good test, but it is not sufficient to ensure that model performance is acceptable. You can access logs and outputs for each pipeline step to review model performance, but it would involve more steps than using TensorBoard.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      Determine the trained model’s location from the pipeline’s metadata in Vertex ML Metadata, and compare the trained model’s size to the previous model.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Model size is a good indicator of health but does not provide a complete overview to make sure that the model can be safely deployed. Note that the pipeline’s metadata can also be accessed directly from Vertex AI Pipelines.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      Request access to production systems. Get the training data’s location from the pipeline’s metadata in Vertex ML Metadata, and compare data volumes of the current run to the previous run.

                    <div>
                      Data is the most probable cause of this behavior, but it is not the only possible cause. Also, access requests could take a long time and are not the most secure option. Note that the pipeline’s metadata can also be accessed directly from Vertex AI Pipelines.

                      You recently developed a custom ML model that was trained in Vertex AI on a post-processed training dataset stored in BigQuery. You used a Cloud Run container to deploy the prediction service. The service performs feature lookup and pre-processing and sends a prediction request to a model endpoint in Vertex AI. You want to configure a comprehensive monitoring solution for training-serving skew that requires minimal maintenance. What should you do?
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      Create a Model Monitoring job for the Vertex AI endpoint that uses the training data in BigQuery to perform training-serving skew detection and uses email to send alerts. When an alert is received, use the console to diagnose the issue.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Vertex AI Model Monitoring is a fully managed solution for monitoring training-serving skew that, by definition, requires minimal maintenance. Using the console for diagnostics is recommended for a comprehensive monitoring solution because there could be multiple causes for the skew that require manual review.

                  </div>

                    <div>
                      This solution does not minimize maintenance. It involves multiple custom components that require additional updates for any schema change.

                      A model retrain does not necessarily fix skew. For example, differences in pre-processing logic between training and prediction can also cause skew.

                      You have a historical data set of the sale price of 10,000 houses and the 10 most important features resulting from principal component analysis (PCA). You need to develop a model that predicts whether a house will sell at one of the following equally distributed price ranges: 200-300k, 300-400k, 400-500k, 500-600k, or 600-700k. You want to use the simplest algorithmic and evaluative approach. What should you do?

                      Define a one-vs-one classification task where each price range is a categorical label. Use F1 score as the metric.

                    <div>
                      This approach is more complex than the classification approach suggested in response B. F1 score is not useful with equally distributed labels, and one-vs-one classification is used for multi-label classification, but the use case would require only one label to be correct.

                    <div>
                      The use case is an ordinal classification task which is most simply solved using multi-class classification. Accuracy as a metric is the best match for a use case with discrete and balanced labels.

                      Define a regression task where the label is the sale price represented as an integer. Use mean absolute error as the metric.

                    <div>
                      Regression is not the recommended approach when solving an ordinal classification task with a small number of discrete values. This specific regression approach adds complexity in comparison to the regression approach suggested in response D because it uses the exact sale price to predict a range. Finally, the mean absolute error would not be the recommended metric because it gives the same penalty for errors of any magnitude.

                      Define a regression task where the label is the average of the price range that corresponds to the house sale price represented as an integer. Use root mean squared error as the metric.

                      Regression is not the recommended approach when solving an ordinal classification task with a small number of discrete values. This specific regression approach would be recommended in comparison to the regression approach suggested in response C because it uses a less complex label and a recommended metric to minimize variance and bias.

                      You downloaded a TensorFlow language model pre-trained on a proprietary dataset by another company, and you tuned the model with Vertex AI Training by replacing the last layer with a custom dense layer. The model achieves the expected offline accuracy; however, it exceeds the required online prediction latency by 20ms. You want to optimize the model to reduce latency while minimizing the offline performance drop before deploying the model to production. What should you do?

                      Post-training quantization is the recommended option for reducing model latency when re-training is not possible. Post-training quantization can minimally decrease model performance.

                      You developed a model for a classification task where the minority class appears in 10% of the data set. You ran the training on the original imbalanced data set and have checked the resulting model performance. The confusion matrix indicates that the model did not learn the minority class. You want to improve the model performance while minimizing run time and keeping the predictions calibrated. What should you do?

                      You have a dataset that is split into training, validation, and test sets. All the sets have similar distributions. You have sub-selected the most relevant features and trained a neural network in TensorFlow. TensorBoard plots show the training loss oscillating around 0.9, with the validation loss higher than the training loss by 0.3. You want to update the training regime to maximize the convergence of both losses and reduce overfitting. What should you do?

                    <div>
                      Changing the learning rate does not reduce overfitting. Increasing the number of training epochs is not expected to improve the losses significantly.

                    <div>
                      Increasing the number of training epochs is not expected to improve the losses significantly, and increasing the learning rate could also make the model training unstable. L1 regularization could be used to stabilize the learning, but it is not expected to be particularly helpful because only the most relevant features have been used for training.

                    <div>
                      L2 regularization prevents overfitting. Increasing the model’s complexity boosts the predictive ability of the model, which is expected to optimize loss convergence when underfitting.

                      You recently used Vertex AI Prediction to deploy a custom-trained model in production. The automated re-training pipeline made available a new model version that passed all unit and infrastructure tests. You want to define a rollout strategy for the new model version that guarantees an optimal user experience with zero downtime. What should you do?

                      Release the new model version in the same Vertex AI endpoint. Use traffic splitting in Vertex AI Prediction to route a small random subset of requests to the new version and, if the new version is successful, gradually route the remaining traffic to it.

                      You trained a model for sentiment analysis in TensorFlow Keras, saved it in SavedModel format, and deployed it with Vertex AI Predictions as a custom container.

                      You used Vertex AI Workbench user-managed notebooks to develop a TensorFlow model. The model pipeline accesses data from Cloud Storage, performs feature engineering and training locally, and outputs the trained model in Vertex AI Model Registry. The end-to-end pipeline takes 10 hours on the attached optimized instance type. You want to introduce model and data lineage for automated re-training runs for this pipeline only while minimizing the cost to run the pipeline. What should you do?

By default, the training data is not weighted. If the training data labels are out of balance, the model can train to predict by weighting the most popular label classes more.<br>It is correct because it uses a moving average of the sensor data and balances the weights using the parameters of BQML, AUTO_CLASS_WEIGHTS.

                      You work for a large financial institution that is planning to use Dialogflow to create a chatbot for the company’s mobile app. You have reviewed old chat logs and tagged each conversation for intent based on each customer’s stated intention for contacting customer service. About 70% of customer inquiries are simple requests that are solved within 10 intents. The remaining 30% of inquiries require much longer and more complicated requests. Which intents should you automate first?

                      You work for a maintenance company and have built and trained a deep learning model that identifies defects based on thermal images of underground electric cables. Your dataset contains 10,000 images, 100 of which contain visible defects. How should you evaluate the performance of the model on a test dataset?

                      Calculate the Area Under the Curve (AUC) value.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      It is scale-invariant. AUC measures how well predictions are ranked, rather than their absolute values. AUC is also classification-threshold invariant. It measures the quality of the model’s predictions irrespective of what classification threshold is chosen.

                    <div>
                      Calculating the number of true positives without considering false positives can lead to misleading results. For instance, the model could classify nearly every image as a defect. This would result in many true positives, but the model would in fact be a very poor discriminator.

                    <div>
                      Merely calculating the fraction of images that contain defects doesn’t indicate whether your model is accurate or not.

                      Calculate the Cosine Similarity to compare the model’s performance on the test dataset to the model’s performance on the training dataset.

                      This metric is more commonly used in distance-based models (e.g., K Nearest Neighbors). This isn’t an appropriate metric for checking the performance of an image classification model.

                      You work for a large retailer. You want to use ML to forecast future sales leveraging 10 years of historical sales data. The historical data is stored in Cloud Storage in Avro format. You want to rapidly experiment with all the available data. How should you build and train your model for the sales forecast?
                    </div>

                      Load data into BigQuery and use the ARIMA model type on BigQuery ML.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      BigQuery ML is designed for fast and rapid experimentation and it is possible to use federated queries to read data directly from Cloud Storage. Moreover, ARIMA is considered one of the best in class for time series forecasting.

                    <div>
                      AutoML is not ideal for fast iteration and rapid experimentation. Even if it does not require data cleanup and hyperparameter tuning, it takes at least one hour to create a model.

                    <div>
                      In order to build a custom TensorFlow model, you would still need to do data cleanup and hyperparameter tuning.

                      Convert and refactor the data into CSV format and use the built-in XGBoost algorithm on Vertex AI custom training.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Using Vertex AI custom training requires preprocessing your data in a particular CSV structure and it is not ideal for fast iteration, as training times can take a long time because it cannot be distributed on multiple machines.

                      You need to build an object detection model for a small startup company to identify if and where the company’s logo appears in an image. You were given a large repository of images, some with logos and some without. These images are not yet labelled. You need to label these pictures, and then train and deploy the model. What should you do?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      Use Google Cloud’s Data Labelling Service to label your data. Use AutoML Object Detection to train and deploy the model.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      This will allow you to easily create a request for a labelling task and deploy a high-performance model.

                      Use Vision API to detect and identify logos in pictures and use it as a label. Use Vertex AI to build and train a convolutional neural network.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Vision API is not guaranteed to work with any company logos, and in the statement it explicitly mentions a small startup, which will further decrease the chance of success.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Create two folders: one where the logo appears and one where it doesn’t. Manually place images in each folder. Use Vertex AI to build and train a convolutional neural network.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      The task of manually labelling the data is time consuming and should be avoided if possible.

                      Create two folders: one where the logo appears and one where it doesn’t. Manually place images in each folder. Use Vertex AI to build and train a real time object detection model.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      The task of labelling object detection data is very tedious, and real time object detection is designed detecting objects in videos rather than in images.

                      You work on a team where the process for deploying a model into production starts with data scientists training different versions of models in a Kubeflow pipeline. The workflow then stores the new model artifact into the corresponding Cloud Storage bucket. You need to build the next steps of the pipeline after the submitted model is ready to be tested and deployed in production on Vertex AI. How should you configure the architecture before deploying the model to production?

                      A farm uses Google’s machine learning technology to detect defective apples in their crop, such as those that are irregular in size or have scratches. The goal is to identify only the apples that are actually bad so that no good apples are wasted. Which metric should the model focus on?

                      The way you deploy a TensorFlow model is different from how you deploy a PyTorch model, and even TensorFlow models might differ based on whether they were created using AutoML or by means of code. True or False: In the unified set of APIs that Vertex AI provides, you can treat all these models in the same way.

                      Human biases lead to bias in machine learning models. Unconscious biases exist in our data and exist in two forms. What are the two forms of unconscious biases in data?

                      There are the human biases that exist in data because data found in “data silos” has existing biases with regard to properties like gender, race, and sexual orientation. We can also run into human biases which arise as part of our data collection and labeling procedures.

                    <div>
                      There are the human biases that exist in data because data found in “the world” has existing biases with regard to properties like gender, race, and sexual orientation. For example, there may be reporting bias by our subjects because they only choose to reveal certain aspects about themselves or their opinions. We can also run into human biases which arise as part of our data collection and labeling procedures.

                      First, there is human bias as a result of reporting, data collection, and labeling. Second, there is human bias as a result of data visualization and analysis.

                      The impact of biases in collecting data and labeling data affects the entire machine learning pipeline. The biases in the original data are going to be reflected downstream in our models and consequently are going to result in potentially biased outcomes. You need to create a checklist for situations where you should watch out for bias-related issues. What questions should this checklist include?

                      When the label says something exists and the model doesn’t predict it—that’s a false negative. So, in the face detection example in this lesson, the model says that there is no face in the image—when the image’s label says there *is* a face.
                    </div>
                    <div>

                    <div>
                      The label says there is no face, and the model finds no face.
                    </div>
                    <div>

                    <div>
                      The label says there is no face, but the model finds a face. Perhaps there is a statue in the image and the model falsely identifies it as a face.

                      True or False: <br> Feature Engineering is often one of the most valuable tasks a data scientist can do to improve model performance, for three main reasons: <br> 1. You can isolate and highlight key information, which helps your algorithms "focus" on what’s important. <br> 2. You can bring in your own <strong>domain expertise</strong>. <br> 3. Once you understand the "vocabulary" of feature engineering, you can bring in other people’s domain expertise.

                      You wouldn't ingest streaming data from BigQuery, although you could stream to it. Pub/Sub is a poor place to store your batch data, although you might use it to replay events.

                      On Google Cloud, the three types of data ingestion map to three different products. If you are ingesting streaming data, use Pub/Sub. If you are ingesting structured data directly into your ML model, use BigQuery, and if you are transforming data from training so that you can train on it later, read from Cloud Storage.

                      A book-recommendation model that suggests novels its users may like based on their popularity (i.e., the number of times the books have been purchased).
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Book recommendations are likely to drive purchases, and these additional sales will be fed back into the model as input, making it more likely to recommend these same books in the future.
                    </div>

                  <div>

                      A housing-value model that predicts house prices, using size (area in square meters), number of bedrooms, and geographic location as features.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      A house's location, size, or number of bedrooms cannot be quickly changed in response to price forecasts, which makes a feedback loop unlikely. However, there is potentially a correlation between size and number of bedrooms (larger homes are likely to have more rooms) that may need to be analyzed.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>

                      A face-attributes model that detects whether a person is smiling in a photo, which is regularly trained on a database of stock photography that is automatically updated monthly.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      There is no feedback loop here, because model predictions don't have any impact on the photo database. However, versioning of the input data is a concern here, because these monthly updates could potentially have unforeseen effects on the model.

                      An election-results model that forecasts the winner of a mayoral race by surveying 2% of voters after the polls have closed.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      If the model does not publish its forecast until after the polls have closed, its predictions cannot affect voter behavior.
                    </div>

                      A traffic-forecasting model that predicts congestion at highway exits near the beach, using beach crowd size as one of its features.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Some beachgoers are likely to base their plans on the traffic forecast. If there is a large beach crowd and traffic is forecast to be heavy, many people may make alternative plans. This may depress beach turnout, resulting in a lighter traffic forecast, which then may increase attendance, and the cycle repeats.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                      The model's rankings may drive additional interest to top-rated schools, increasing the number of applications they receive. If these schools continue to admit the same number of students, selectivity will increase (the percentage of students admitted will go down). This will boost these schools' rankings, which will further increase prospective student interest, and so on…

                      Suppose you are building an ML-based system to predict the likelihood that a customer will leave a positive review. The user interface that customers leave reviews on changed a few months ago, but you don't know about this. Which of these is a potential consequence of mismanaging this data dependency?

                      For example, a review might be easier to write, and so your prediction of whether someone will leave a review (whether good or bad) is too low because it was trained on reviews that resulted from the older, harder-to-use user interface

                      If each of your examples is large in terms of size and requires parsing, and your model is relatively simple and shallow, your model is likely to be:

                    <div>
                      Your ML training will be I/O bound if the number of inputs is large or  heterogeneous (requires parsing) or if the model is so small that the compute requirements are trivial. This also tends to be the case if the input data is on a storage system with low throughput. If you are I/O bound, look at storing the data more efficiently, storing the data on a storage system with higher throughput, or parallelizing the reads. Although it is not ideal, you might consider reducing the batch size so that you are reading less data in each step.

                      A pooling layer that relies on max-pooling does not require any weights, because the operation only cares about the largest of the input values evaluated by the kernel. This means that during training none of the parameters of the pooling layer need to change.

                  It doesn't matter which neuron is trained to process which input values in a dense layer.<br>If you randomly reshuffle the order of the pixels in the images, the classification performance stays the same, because the corresponding weights are also reshuffled.<br>However, when human beings look at an image where the pixels are randomly reshuffled, the image looks like noise.<br>This phenomenon happens because the concept of hierarchy plays a significant role in the human brain.<br>Information is stored in sequence of patterns, in sequential order.<br>Similarly, you can expect the CNNs to perform poorly in contrast to DNN models if the image pixels are randomly permitted.<br>This is because hierarchy, or how pixels are placed next to each other, is a vital part of the CNN model design.<br><br>

                      Before raw images can be fed into an image model, they usually have to be preprocessed. These preprocessing operations can include resizing, converting between color spaces, cropping, flipping, rotating and transposing for shape transformation or image adjustments, segmentation, and compression for quality enhancement.

                    <div>
                      Content-based systems require that we either base our recommendations solely on the properties of the items, by looking for similar items for example, or that we have representations of our users in the same embedding space of our items. For a trivial example, by asking users which genres they prefer, we could make content-based recommendations using representations of items with genres as features.

                      Suppose you want to build a collaborative filter to suggest new hiking trails for users. The problem is you don't have any good explicit user ratings for trails. What feature might be useful for creating an implicit measure of a user's rating for a trail instead?
                    </div>
                  </div>

                    <div>
                      The length of the trail is constant across all users so it can't be a measure of an individual user's rating of a particular trail.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">

                      The number of times the user hiked that trail
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      The decision to hike a trail can be reasonably interpreted as an implicit measure of user preference.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>

                      The distance of the trail to the user's home.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Distance to the trail better captured using a knowledge-based recommendation system.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                      The number of times all users hiked a trail would be a useful measure of objective or consensus quality but it would not be able to capture an individual users' preference.

                      When building a content-based recommender system, it's important to express both your items and users using the same embedding space (that is. the same dimensions and features).

                    <div>
                      We calculate our recommendation using the product of the user embedding and the item embedding, so it's critical that the dimensions of these two embeddings are the same.

                      Think again about the computation we perform to generate predictions for a given user: we multiply a user-feature vector by an item-feature vector to get a prediction. In order for this multiplication to make sense, the shape of the vectors and the meaning of each dimension need to be the same.

                      ALS and WALS create embedding tables for both users and items. Because these are held in memory, it's important to plan for their size. How big would you expect the embedding table for the users to be?

                    <div>
                      The embeddings table has a number of rows equal to the number of users and a number of columns equal to the embedding size, which is a hyper parameter. While the embedding size could theoretically be the same as the number of users, in practice, this number is never that big.

                      You want to create a hybrid recommendation system to suggest music for new users on your music streaming app that just launched. New users are asked to rate a few bands they like. You have reliable data for artist name, song name, album name, etc. Each song is labeled for genre at a coarse level (rock, pop, etc.). Which component of your recommendation system will likely perform the best?
                    </div>
                  </div>

                    </div>
                    <div>
                      The performance of the collaborative filtering component is determined by the density of the ratings matrix. Because our app just launched, and because explicit feedback is so rare, our collaborative filtering recommendations will likely be poor.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                      Because the user has entered some basic preferences, and because we have reliable metadata for each song, we can recommend songs with the same metadata or allow users to find such songs on their own.

                    <div>
                      The performance of the content-based component is determined by the quality of the representations of the content. In this case, we know very little about each song. Our genre labels are coarse and we have no representations of the raw audio itself.

                      Suppose you want to develop a supervised machine learning model to predict whether a given email is "spam" or "not spam." Which of the following statements are true?
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      Emails not marked as "spam" or "not spam" are unlabeled examples.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Because our label consists of the values "spam" and "not spam", any email not yet marked as spam or not spam is an unlabeled example.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                      Words in the subject header might make excellent features, but they won't make good labels.

                      We'll use unlabeled examples to train the model.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      We'll use <b>labeled</b> examples to train the model. We can then run the trained model against unlabeled examples to infer whether the unlabeled email messages are spam or not spam.

                      The labels applied to some examples might be unreliable.

                    <div>
                      Definitely. It's important to check how reliable your data is. The labels for this dataset probably come from email users who mark particular email messages as spam. Since most users do not mark every suspicious email message as spam, we may have trouble knowing whether an email is spam. Furthermore, spammers could intentionally poison our model by providing faulty labels.

                      Suppose an online shoe store wants to create a supervised ML model that will provide personalized shoe recommendations to users. That is, the model will recommend certain pairs of shoes to Marty and different pairs of shoes to Janet. The system will use past user behavior data to generate training data. Which of the following statements are true?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      "Shoe size" is a useful feature.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      "Shoe size" is a quantifiable signal that likely has a strong impact on whether the user will like the recommended shoes. For example, if Marty wears size 9, the model shouldn't recommend size 7 shoes.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      "Shoe beauty" is a useful feature.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Good features are concrete and quantifiable. Beauty is too vague a concept to serve as a useful feature. Beauty is probably a blend of certain concrete features, such as style and color. Style and color would each be better features than beauty.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      "The user clicked on the shoe's description" is a useful label.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Users probably only want to read more about those shoes that they like. Clicks by users is, therefore, an observable, quantifiable metric that could serve as a good training label. Since our training data derives from past user behavior, our labels need to derive from objective behaviors like clicks that strongly correlate with user preferences

                      "Shoes that a user adores" is a useful label.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Adoration is not an observable, quantifiable metric. The best we can do is search for observable proxy metrics for adoration.

                      The six examples on the line incur a total loss of 0. The four examples not on the line are not very far off the line, so even squaring their offset still yields a low value: $$ MSE = \frac{0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} {10} = 0.4$$

                      The eight examples on the line incur a total loss of 0. However, although only two points lay off the line, both of those points are <i>twice</i> as far off the line as the outlier points in the left figure. Squared loss amplifies those differences, so an offset of two incurs a loss four times as great as an offset of one. $$ MSE = \frac{0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 + 0^2} {10} = 0.8$$

                      When performing gradient descent on a large data set, which of the following batch sizes will likely be more efficient?
                    </div>

                      The full batch.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Computing the gradient from a full batch is inefficient. That is, the gradient can usually be computed far more efficiently (and just as accurately) from a smaller batch than from a vastly bigger full batch.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      A small batch or even a batch of one example (SGD).
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Amazingly enough, performing gradient descent on a small batch or even a batch of one example is usually more efficient than the full batch. After all, finding the gradient of one example is far cheaper than finding the gradient of millions of examples. To ensure a good representative sample, the algorithm scoops up another random small batch (or batch of one) on every iteration.

                      We looked at a process of using a test set and a training set to drive iterations of model development. On each iteration, we'd train on the training data and evaluate on the test data, using the evaluation results on test data to guide choices of and changes to various model hyperparameters like learning rate and features. Is there anything wrong with this approach?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Totally fine, we're training on training data and evaluating on separate, held-out test data.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Actually, there's a subtle issue here. Think about what might happen if we did many, many iterations of this form.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      Doing many rounds of this procedure might cause us to implicitly fit to the peculiarities of our specific test set.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Yes indeed! The more often we evaluate on a given test set, the more we are at risk for implicitly overfitting to that one test set.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      This is computationally inefficient. We should just pick a default set of hyperparameters and live with them to save resources.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Although these sorts of iterations are expensive, they are a critical part of model development. Hyperparameter settings can make an enormous difference in model quality, and we should always budget some amount of time and computational resources to ensure we're getting the best quality we can.

                      Different cities in California have markedly different <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/california-housing-data-description">housing prices</a>. Suppose you must create a model to predict housing prices. Which of the following sets of features or feature crosses could learn <i>city-specific</i> relationships between <code translate="no" dir="ltr">roomsPerPerson</code> and housing price?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Three separate binned features: <tt>[binned latitude], [binned longitude], [binned roomsPerPerson]</tt>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Binning is good because it enables the model to learn nonlinear relationships within a single feature. However, a city exists in more than one dimension, so learning city-specific relationships requires crossing latitude and longitude.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      One feature cross: <tt> [latitude X longitude X roomsPerPerson]</tt>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      In this example, crossing real-valued features is not a good idea. Crossing the real value of, say, latitude with roomsPerPerson enables a 10% change in one feature (say, latitude) to be equivalent to a 10% change in the other feature (say, roomsPerPerson).
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      One feature cross: <tt>[binned latitude X binned longitude X binned roomsPerPerson]</tt>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Crossing binned latitude with binned longitude enables the model to learn city-specific effects of roomsPerPerson. Binning prevents a change in latitude producing the same result as a change in longitude. Depending on the granularity of the bins, this feature cross could learn city-specific or neighborhood-specific or even block-specific effects.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Two feature crosses: <tt>[binned latitude X binned roomsPerPerson] </tt> and <tt>[binned longitude X binned roomsPerPerson]</tt>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Binning is a good idea; however, a city is the conjunction of latitude and longitude, so separate feature crosses prevent the model from learning city-specific prices.

                      Imagine a linear model with 100 input features: <li> 10 are highly informative.</li> <li> 90 are non-informative.</li> Assume that all features have values between -1 and 1. Which of the following statements are true?

                    <div>
                      L<sub>2</sub> regularization does not tend to force weights to exactly 0.0. L<sub>2</sub> regularization penalizes larger weights more than smaller weights. As a weight gets close to 0.0, L<sub>2</sub> "pushes" less forcefully toward 0.0.

                      L<sub>2</sub> regularization may cause the model to learn a moderate weight for some <b>non-informative</b> features.

                      Surprisingly, this can happen when a non-informative feature happens to be correlated with the label. In this case, the model incorrectly gives such non-informative features some of the "credit" that should have gone to informative features.

                      Imagine a linear model with two strongly correlated features; that is, these two features are nearly identical copies of one another but one feature contains a small amount of random noise. If we train this model with L<sub>2</sub> regularization, what will happen to the weights for these two features?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      Both features will have roughly equal, moderate weights.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      L<sub>2</sub> regularization will force the features towards roughly equivalent weights that are approximately half of what they would have been had only one of the two features been in the model.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      One feature will have a large weight; the other will have a weight of <strong>almost</strong> 0.0.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      L<sub>2</sub> regularization penalizes large weights more than small weights. So, even if one weight started to drop faster than the other, L<sub>2</sub> regularization would tend to force the bigger weight to drop more quickly than the smaller weight.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      L<sub>2</sub> regularization rarely forces weights to exactly 0.0. By contrast, L<sub>1</sub> regularization <i>does</i> force weights to exactly 0.0.

                      In which of the following scenarios would a high accuracy value suggest that the ML model is doing a good job?

                      A deadly, but curable, medical condition afflicts .01% of the population. An ML model uses symptoms as features and predicts this affliction with an accuracy of 99.99%.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Accuracy is a poor metric here. After all, even a "dumb" model that always predicts "not sick" would still be 99.99% accurate. Mistakenly predicting "not sick" for a person who actually is sick could be deadly.

                      An expensive robotic chicken crosses a very busy road a thousand times per day. An ML model evaluates traffic patterns and predicts when this chicken can safely cross the street with an accuracy of 99.99%.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      A 99.99% accuracy value on a very busy road strongly suggests that the ML model is far better than chance. In some settings, however, the cost of making even a small number of mistakes is still too high. 99.99% accuracy means that the expensive chicken will need to be replaced, on average, every 10 days. (The chicken might also cause extensive damage to cars that it hits.)

                      In the game of roulette, a ball is dropped on a spinning wheel and eventually lands in one of 38 slots. Using visual features (the spin of the ball, the position of the wheel when the ball was dropped, the height of the ball over the wheel), an ML model can predict the slot that the ball will land in with an accuracy of 4%.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      This ML model is making predictions far better than chance; a random guess would be correct 1/38 of the time—yielding an accuracy of 2.6%. Although the model's accuracy is "only" 4%, the benefits of success far outweigh the disadvantages of failure.

                      While better precision is good, it might be coming at the expense of a large reduction in recall. In general, we need to look at both precision and recall together, or summary metrics like AUC which we'll talk about next.

                      In general, a model that outperforms another model on both precision and recall is likely the better model. Obviously, we'll need to make sure that comparison is being done at a precision / recall point that is useful in practice for this to be meaningful. For example, suppose our spam detection model needs to have at least 90% precision to be useful and avoid unnecessary false alarms. In this case, comparing one model at {20% precision, 99% recall} to another at {15% precision, 98% recall} is not particularly instructive, as neither model meets the 90% precision requirement. But with that caveat in mind, this is a good way to think about comparing models when using precision and recall.

                      How would multiplying all of the predictions from a given model by 2.0 (for example, if the model predicts 0.4, we multiply by 2.0 to get a prediction of 0.8) change the model's performance as measured by AUC?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      No change. AUC only cares about relative prediction scores.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Yes, AUC is based on the relative predictions, so any transformation of the predictions that preserves the relative ranking has no effect on AUC. This is clearly not the case for other metrics such as squared error, log loss, or prediction bias.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      It would make AUC terrible, since the prediction values are now way off.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Interestingly enough, even though the prediction values are different (and likely farther from the truth), multiplying them all by 2.0 would keep the relative ordering of prediction values the same. Since AUC only cares about relative rankings, it is not impacted by any simple scaling of the predictions.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      It would make AUC better, because the prediction values are all farther apart.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      The amount of spread between predictions does not actually impact AUC. Even a prediction score for a randomly drawn true positive is only a tiny epsilon greater than a randomly drawn negative, that will count that as a success contributing to the overall AUC score.

                      Which one of the following statements is true of dynamic (online) training?
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      The model stays up to date as new data arrives.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      This is the primary benefit of online training—we can avoid many staleness issues by allowing the model to train on new data as it comes in.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Very little monitoring of training jobs needs to be done.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Actually, you must continuously monitor training jobs to ensure that they are healthy and working as intended. You'll also need supporting infrastructure like the ability to roll a model back to a previous snapshot in case something goes wrong in training, such as a buggy job or corruption in input data.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      Very little monitoring of input data needs to be done at inference time.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Just like a static, offline model, it is also important to monitor the inputs to the dynamically updated models. We are likely not at risk for large seasonality effects, but sudden, large changes to inputs (such as an upstream data source going down) can still cause unreliable predictions.

                      Which of the following statements are true about static (offline) training?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>

                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Actually, if we train offline, then the model has no way to incorporate new data as it arrives. This can lead to model staleness, if the distribution we are trying to learn from changes over time.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      You can verify the model before applying it in production.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Yes, offline training gives ample opportunity to verify model performance before introducing the model in production.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      Offline training requires less monitoring of training jobs than online training.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      In general, monitoring requirements at training time are more modest for offline training, which insulates us from many production considerations. However, the more frequently you train your model, the higher the investment you'll need to make in monitoring. You'll also want to validate regularly to ensure that changes to your code (and its dependencies) don't adversely affect model quality.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Counterintuitively, you do need to monitor input data at serving time. If the input distributions change, then our model's predictions may become unreliable. Imagine, for example, a model trained only on summertime clothing data suddenly being used to predict clothing buying behavior in wintertime.

                      In offline inference, we make predictions on a big batch of data all at once. We then put those predictions in a look-up table for later use. Which of the following are true of offline inference?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      We must create predictions for all possible inputs.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Yes, we will have to make predictions for all possible inputs and store them into a cache or lookup table to use offline inference. This is one of the drawbacks of offline inference. We will only be able to serve a prediction for those examples that we already know about. This is fine if the set of things that we're predicting is limited, like all world cities or all items in a database table. But for freeform inputs like user queries that have a long tail of unusual or rare items, we would not be able to provide full coverage with an offline-inference system.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      After generating the predictions, we can verify them before applying them.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      This is indeed one useful thing about offline inference. We can sanity check and verify all of our predictions before they are used.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      For a given input, we can serve a prediction more quickly than with <i>online</i> inference.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    </div>

                  <div>
                    <div>
                      We will need to carefully monitor our input signals over a long period of time.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      This is the one case where we don't actually need to monitor input signals over a long period of time. This is because once the predictions have been written to a look-up table, we're no longer dependent on the input features. Note that any subsequent update of the model will require a new round of input verification.
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <div>
                      We will be able to react quickly to changes in the world.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      No, this is a drawback of offline inference. We'll need to wait until a new set of predictions have been written to the look-up table before we can respond differently based on any changes in the world.

                      Dynamic (online) inference means making predictions on demand. That is, in online inference, we put the trained model on a server and issue inference requests as needed. Which of the following are true of dynamic inference?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">
                    <div>
                      You can provide predictions for all possible items.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Yes, this is a strength of online inference. Any request that comes in will be given a score. Online inference handles long-tail distributions (those with many rare items), like the space of all possible sentences written in movie reviews.
                    </div>
                  </div>

                      You can do post-verification of predictions before they are used.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      In general, it's not possible to do a post-verification of all predictions before they get used because predictions are being made on demand. You can, however, potentially monitor <i>aggregate</i> prediction qualities to provide some level of sanity checking, but these will signal fire alarms only after the fire has already spread.
                    </div>

                    <div>
                      Yes. Signals could change suddenly due to upstream issues, harming our predictions.

                      When performing online inference, you do not need to worry about prediction latency (the lag time for returning predictions) as much as when performing offline inference.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Prediction latency is often a real concern in online inference. Unfortunately, you can't necessarily fix prediction latency issues by adding more inference servers.

                    <div>
                      Some beachgoers are likely to base their plans on the traffic forecast. If there is a large beach crowd and traffic is forecast to be heavy, many people may make alternative plans. This may depress beach turnout, resulting in a lighter traffic forecast, which then may increase attendance, and the cycle repeats.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                      If the model does not publish its forecast until after the polls have closed, it is not possible for its predictions to affect voter behavior.

                      A housing-value model that predicts house prices, using size (area in square meters), number of bedrooms, and geographic location as features.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      It is not possible to quickly change a house's location, size, or number of bedrooms in response to price forecasts, making a feedback loop unlikely. However, there is potentially a correlation between size and number of bedrooms (larger homes are likely to have more rooms) that may need to be teased apart.

                      A face-attributes model that detects whether a person is smiling in a photo, which is regularly trained on a database of stock photography that is automatically updated monthly.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      There is no feedback loop here, as model predictions don't have any impact on our photo database. However, versioning of our input data is a concern here, as these monthly updates could potentially have unforeseen effects on the model.

                      A German handwriting recognition smartphone app uses a model that frequently incorrectly classifies <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F">ß</a> (Eszett) characters as <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/B">B</a> characters, because it was trained on a corpus of American handwriting samples, mostly written in English.

                    <div>
                      This model was affected by a type of selection bias called <strong>coverage bias</strong>: the training data (American English handwriting) was not representative of the type of data provided by the model's target audience (German handwriting).

                      Engineers built a model to predict the likelihood of a person developing diabetes based on their daily food intake. The model was trained on 10,000 "food diaries" collected from a randomly chosen group of people worldwide representing a variety of different age groups, ethnic backgrounds, and genders. However, when the model was deployed, it had very poor accuracy. Engineers subsequently discovered that food diary participants were reluctant to admit the true volume of unhealthy foods they ate, and were more likely to document consumption of nutritious food than less healthy snacks.

                      There is no selection bias in this model; participants who provided training data were a representative sampling of users and were chosen randomly. Instead, this model was affected by <strong>reporting bias</strong>. Ingestion of unhealthy foods was reported at a much lower frequency than true real-world occurrence.

                      Engineers at a company developed a model to predict staff turnover rates (the percentage of employees quitting their jobs each year) based on data collected from a survey sent to all employees. After several years of use, engineers determined that the model underestimated turnover by more than 20%. When conducting exit interviews with employees leaving the company, they learned that more than 80% of people who were dissatisfied with their jobs chose not to complete the survey, compared to a company-wide opt-out rate of 15%.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      This model was affected by a type of selection bias called <strong>non-response bias</strong>. People who were dissatisfied with their jobs were underrepresented in the training data set because they opted out of the company-wide survey at much higher rates than the entire employee population.

                      Engineers developing a movie-recommendation system hypothesized that people who like horror movies will also like science-fiction movies. When they trained a model on 50,000 users' watchlists, however, it showed no such correlation between preferences for horror and for sci-fi; instead it showed a strong correlation between preferences for horror and for documentaries. This seemed odd to them, so they retrained the model five more times using different hyperparameters. Their final trained model showed a 70% correlation between preferences for horror and for sci-fi, so they confidently released it into production.

                    <div>
                      There is no evidence of selection bias, but this model may have instead been affected by <strong>experimenter's bias</strong>, as the engineers kept iterating on their model until it confirmed their preexisting hypothesis.

All the true negatives would be changed to false positives:</p> <table border="1"> <tr> <td class="mlcc-good"> <b>True Positives (TPs): 4324</b> </td> <td class="mlcc-bad"> <b>False Positives (FPs): 5676</b> </td> </tr> <tr> <td class="mlcc-bad"> <b>False Negatives (FNs): 0</b> </td> <td class="mlcc-good"> <b>True Negatives (TNs): 0</b> </td> </tr> </table> <p>which would decrease the precision rate from 0.957 to 0.432. So, adding this calibration would change the type of error but would not mitigate the magnitude of the error. </p>

                      An industrial company wants to improve its quality system. It has developed its own deep neural network model with Tensorflow to identify the semi-finished products to be discarded with images taken from the production lines in the various production phases. During training, your custom model converges, but the tests are giving unsatisfactory results.<br><br>What do you think might be the problem, and how could you proceed to fix it?

                      A Convolutional Neural Network is a Deep Neural Network in which the layers are made up of processed sections of the source image. This technique allows you to simplify images and highlight shapes and features regardless of the physical position in which they may be found.<br>For example, if we have the same signature in the center or at the bottom right of an image, the object will be different. But the signature is the same. A neural network that compares these derived features and can simplify the model achieves the best results.

                      Multiclass logistic regression deals with a classification problem with multiple solutions, fixed and finite classes. It is an extension of binary logistic regression with basically the same principles with the assumption of several independent variables. But in image recognition problems, the best results are achieved with CNN because they are capable of finding and relating patterns positioned in different ways on the images.

                      The purpose of your current project is the recognition of genuine or forged signatures on checks and documents against regular signatures already stored by the Bank. There is obviously a very low incidence of fake signatures. The system must recognize which customer the signature belongs to and whether the signature is identified as genuine or skilled forged.<br><br>Which of the following technical specifications can't you use with CNN?

                    <div>
                      A custom Tensorflow model needs more time and effort. Moreover, an autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network that is used in the case of unlabeled data (unsupervised learning). The autoencoder is an excellent system for generalization and therefore to reduce dimensionality, training the network to ignore insignificant data ("noise") is not our scope.

                          Various banking applications will send transactions to the new system in real-time and in standard/normalized format.

                      The k-means clustering is a mathematical and statistical method on numerical vectors that divides and observes k clusters. Each example belongs to the cluster with the closest mean (cluster centroid).<br>In ML, it is an unsupervised classification method and is widely used to detect unusual or outlier movements. For these reasons, it is one of the main methods for fraud detection.<br>But it is not the only method because not all frauds are linked to strange movements. There may be other factors.

                      It is an open-source project and this is the description from its Github page:<br>XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solves many data science problems in a fast and accurate way. The same code runs on major distributed environments (Kubernetes, Hadoop, SGE, MPI, Dask) and can solve problems beyond billions of examples.

                  When there is an imbalance between true and false ratios in binary classification, it is necessary to modify the classification threshold so that the most probable errors are those with minor consequences. In our case, it is better to be wrong with a healthy person than with a sick one.<br>Accuracy is the number of correct predictions on the total of predictions done.<br>Let’s imagine that we have 100 predictions, and 95 of them are correct. That is 95%. It looks almost perfect.<br>But we assume that the system has foreseen 94 true negative cases and only one true positive case, and one case of false positive, and 4 cases of false negative.<br>So, the model predicted 98 healthy when they were 95 and 2 suspected cases when they were 5.<br>The problem is that sick patients are, luckily, a minimal percentage. But it is important that they are intercepted. So, our model failed because it correctly identified only 1 case out of the total of 5 real positives that is 20% (recall). It also identified 2 positives, one of which was negative, i.e. 50% (precision).<br>It's not good at all.<br><b>Precision</b>: Rate of correct positive identifications<br><b>Recall</b>: Rate of real positives correctly identified<br>To calibrate the result, we need to change the threshold we use to decide between positive and negative. The model does not return 0 and 1 but a value between 0 and 1 (sigmoid activation function). In our case, we have to choose a threshold lower than 0.5 to classify it as positive. In this way, we risk carrying out further investigations on the healthy but being able to treat more sick patients. It is definitely the desired result.<br><br>

                      Your customer has an online dating platform that, among other things, analyzes the degree of affinity between the various people. Obviously, it already uses ML models and uses, in particular, XGBoost, the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm, and is obtaining excellent results.<br><br>All its development processes follow CI / CD specifications and use Docker containers. The requirement is to classify users in various ways and update models frequently, based on new parameters entered into the platform by the users themselves.<br><br>So, the problem you are called to solve is how to optimize frequently re-trained operations with an optimized workflow system.<br><br>Which solution among these proposals can best solve your needs?

                    <div>
                      Feature clipping eliminates outliers that are too high or too low.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                      When you don't have a fairly uniform distribution, you can instead use Log Scaling which can compress the data range: x1 = log (x)

                    <div>
                      Z-Score is similar to scaling, but uses the deviation from the mean divided by the standard deviation, which is the classic index of variability. So, it gives how many standard deviations each value is away from the mean.

                    <div>
                      Scaling means transforming feature values into a standard range, from 0 and 1 or sometimes -1 to +1. It's okay when you have an even distribution between minimum and maximum.

The higher it is, the more underfitting there is.<br>Variance is the sensitivity to differences in the training set. The higher it is, the more overfitting there is.

                      BigQuery and BigQuery ML are powerful services for data analysis and machine learning.<br>They are fully serverless services that can process petabytes of data in public and private datasets and even data stored in files.<br>BigQuery works with standard SQL and has a CLI interface: bq.<br>You can use BigQuery jobs to automate and schedule tasks and operations.<br>With BigQuery ML, you can train models with a rich set of algorithms with data already stored in the Cloud. You may perform feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning and export a BigQuery ML model to a Docker image as required.

                      You have a Linear Regression model for the optimal management of supplies to a sales network based on a large number of different driving factors. You want to simplify the model to make it more efficient and faster. Your first goal is to synthesize the features without losing the information content that comes from them.<br><br>Which of these is the best technique?

                    <div>
                      Principal component analysis is a technique to reduce the number of features by creating new variables obtained from linear combinations or mixes of the original variables, which can then replace them but retain most of the information useful for the model. In addition, the new features are all independent of each other.<br>The new variables are called principal components.<br>A linear model is assumed as a basis. Therefore, the variables are independent of each other.

                      Feedforward neural networks are the classic example of neural networks. In fact, they were the first and most elementary type of artificial neural network. Feedforward neural networks are mainly used for supervised learning when the data, mainly numerical, to be learned is neither time-series nor sequential (such as NLP).<br>These networks do not have any loops or loops in the network. Information moves in one direction only, forward, from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes.

                      You work for a large retail company. You are preparing a marketing model. The model will have to make predictions based on the historical and analytical data of the e-commerce site (analytics-360). In particular, customer loyalty and remarketing possibilities should be studied. You work on historical tabular data. You want to quickly create an optimal model, both from the point of view of the algorithm used and the tuning and life cycle of the model.<br><br>What are the two best services you can use?

                      AutoML can select the best model for your needs without having to experiment.<br>The architectures currently used (they are added at the same time) are:
                      <ul>
                        <li>

                        <li>
                          Normalization

                        <li>
                          Encoding and embeddings for categorical features.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Timestamp columns management (important in our case)
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      So, it has special features for time columns: for example, it can correctly split the input data into training, validation and testing.

                      You are a junior Data Scientist, and you need to create a new classification Machine Learning model with Tensorflow.

                      You are training a set of modes that should be simple, using regression techniques. During training, your model seems to work. But the tests are giving unsatisfactory results. You discover that you have several wrongs and missing data. You need a tool that helps you cope with them.<br><br>Which of the following problems is not related to Data Validation?

                    <div>
                      Omitted values are a problem because they may change fundamental statistics like average, for example.

                      Categories are not related to Data Validation. Usually, they are categorical, string variables that in ML usually are mapped in a numerical set before training.

                      In your company you use Tensorflow and Keras as main libraries for Machine Learning and your data is stored in disk files, so block storage.<br><br>Recently there has been the migration of all the management computing systems to Google Cloud and management has requested that the files should be stored in Cloud Storage and that the tabular data should be stored in BigQuery and pre-processed with Dataflow.<br><br>Which of the following techniques is NOT suitable for accessing tabular data as required?

                    <div>
                      Python BigQuery client library allows you to get BigQuery data in Panda, so it's definitely useful in this environment.

                    <div>
                      BigQuery I/O Connector is used by Dataflow (Apache Beam) for reading Data for transformation and processing, as required.

                    <div>
                      tf.data.Iterator is used for enumerating elements in a Dataset, using Tensorflow API, so it is not suitable for accessing tabular data.

                      tf.data.dataset reader is wrong because you must first access the data using the tf.data.dataset reader for BigQuery.

                    <div>
                      Scaling to a range converts numbers into a standard range ( 0 to 1 or -1 to 1).

                    <div>
                      z-test is not correct because it is a statistic that is used to prove if a sample mean belongs to a specific population. For example, it is used in medical trials to prove whether a new drug is effective or not.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Log Scaling uses the logarithms instead of your values to change the shape. This is possible because the log function preserves monotonicity.

                      Z-score is a variation of scaling: the resulting number is divided by the standard deviations. It is aimed at obtaining distributions with mean = 0 and std = 1.

                      Feature engineering means transforming input data, often strings, into a feature vector.<br>Lots of effort is spent in mapping categorical values in the best way: we have to convert strings to numeric values. We have to define a vocabulary of possible values, usually mapped to integer values.<br>We remember that in an ML model everything must be translated into numbers. Therefore it is easy to run into problems of this type.<br>Vertex Feature Store is a service to organize and store ML features through a central store.<br>This allows you to share and optimize ML features important for the specific environment and to reuse them at any time.<br>All these translate into the greater speed of the creation of ML services. But these also allow minimizing problems such as processing skew, which occurs when the distribution of data in production is different from that of training, often due to errors in the organization of the features.<br>For example, Training-serving skew may happen when your training data uses a different unit of measure than prediction requests.<br>So, Training-serving skew happens when you generate your training data differently than you generate the data you use to request predictions. For example, if you use an average value, and for training purposes, you average over 10 days, but you average over the last month when you request prediction.

                      Your company runs a big retail website. You develop many ML models for all the business activities. You migrated to Google Cloud when you were using Vertex AI. Your models are developed with PyTorch, TensorFlow and BigQuery ML.<br><br>You also use BigTable and CloudSQL, and of course Cloud Storage. In many cases, the same data is used for multiple models and projects. And your data is continuously updated, sometimes in streaming mode.<br><br>Which is the best way to organize the input data?

                    <div>
                      Dataflow deals with Data Pipelines and is not a way to access and organize data.

                    <div>
                      CSV is just a data format, and an ML Dataset is made with data and metadata dealing with many different formats.

                    <div>
                      BigQuery and BigTable are just one of the ways in which you can store data. Moreover, BigTable is not currently supported for data store for Vertex datasets.

                      Because Datasets are suitable for all kinds of libraries, it is a useful abstraction for this requirement.

                      PyTorch is a popular library for deep learning that you can leverage using GPUs and CPUs.<br>When you have to save a model for resuming training, you have to record both models and updated buffers and parameters in a checkpoint.<br>A checkpoint is an intermediate dump of a model’s entire internal state (its weights, current learning rate, etc.) so that the framework can resume the training from that very point.<br>In other words, you train for a few iterations, then evaluate the model, checkpoint it, then fit some more. When you are done, save the model and deploy it as normal.<br>To save checkpoints, you must use torch.save() to serialize the dictionary of all your state data,<br>In order to reload, the command is torch.load().

                      ML training Manages three main data categories:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          <b>Training data</b> is also called examples or records. It is the main input for model configuration and, in supervised learning, presents labels, that are the correct answers based on past experience. Input data is used to build the model but will not be part of the model.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <b>Parameters</b> are instead the variables to be found to solve the riddle. They are part of the final model and they make the difference among similar models of the same type.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          <b>Hyperparameters</b> are configuration variables that influence the training process itself: Learning rate, hidden layers number, number of epochs, regularization, batch size are all examples of hyperparameters.
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      Hyperparameters tuning is made during the training job and used to be a manual and tedious process, made by running multiple trials with different values.<br>The time required to train and test a model can depend upon the choice of its hyperparameters.<br>With Vertex AI you just need to prepare a simple YAML configuration without coding.

                      As a Data Scientist, you are involved in various projects in an important retail company. You prefer to use, whenever possible, simple and easily explained algorithms. Where you can't get satisfactory results, you adopt more complex and sophisticated methods. Your manager told you that you should try ensemble methods. Intrigued, you are documented.<br><br>Which of the following are ensemble-type algorithms?

                      Random forests are made with multiple decision trees, random sampling, a subset of variables and optimization techniques at each step (voting the best models).<br>AdaBoost is built with multiple decision trees, too, with the following differences:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          It creates stumps, that is, trees with only one node and two leaves.
                        </li>

                      XGBoost is currently very popular. It is similar to Gradient Boost with the following differences:

                        <li>
                          Leaf nodes pruning, that is regularization in order to keep the best ones for generalization

                          Newton Boosting instead of gradient descent, so math-based and faster

                  In Vertex AI, you may enable or avoid logs for prediction. When you want to change, you must undeploy and redeploy.<br>There are two types of logs:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Container logging, which logs data from the containers hosting your model; so these logs are essential for problem solving and debugging.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Access logging, which logs accesses and latency information.

                  Therefore, you need Container logging.<br><br>

                      You are a junior Data Scientist working on a logistic regression model to break down customer text messages into two categories: important / urgent and unimportant / non-urgent.<br><br>You want to find a metric that allows you to evaluate your model for how well it separates the two classes. You are interested in finding a method that is scale invariant and classification threshold invariant.<br><br>Which of the following is the optimal methodology?

                      Log Loss is a loss function used especially for logistic regression; it measures loss. So it is highly dependent on threshold values.

                      One-hot encoding is a method used in feature engineering for obtaining better regularization and independence.

                    <div>
                      The ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is a graph showing the behavior of the model with positive guesses at different classification thresholds.<br>It plots and relates each others two different values:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          TPR: true positives / all actual positives
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          FPR: false positives / all actual negatives
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      The AUC (Area Under the Curve) index is the area under the ROC curve and indicates the capability of a binary classifier to discriminate between two categories. Being a probability, it is always a value between 0 and 1. Hence it is a scale invariant.<br>It provides divisibility between classes. So it is independent of the chosen threshold value; in other words, it is threshold-invariant.<br>When it is equal, it is 0.5 indicating that the model randomly foresees the division between two classes, similar to what happens with heads and tails when tossing coins.

                  When you develop and test a model, the eager mode is really useful because it lets you execute operations one by one and facilitate debugging.<br>But when in production, it is better to use graphs, which are data structures with Tensors and integrated computations Python independent. In this way, they can be deployed on different devices (like mobiles) and are optimizable.<br>To do that, you have to use tf.function decoration function for a new tf.Graph creation.<br><br>

                      You are a junior data scientist working on a logistic regression model to break down customer text messages into important/urgent and important / not urgent. You want to use the best loss function that you can use to determine your model's performance.<br><br>Which of the following is the optimal methodology?
                    </div>
                  </div>
                  <div correct="">

                      Log Loss
                    </div>
                    <div>
                      With a logistic regression model, the optimal loss function is the log loss.<br>The intuitive explanation is that when you want to emphasize the loss of bigger mistakes, you need to find a way to penalize such differences.<br>In this case, it is often used the square loss. But in the case of probabilistic values (between 0 and 1), the squaring decreases the values; it does not make them bigger.<br>On the other hand, with a logarithmic transformation, the process is reversed: decimal values get bigger.<br>In addition, logarithmic transformations do not modify the minimum and maximum characteristics (monotonic functions).<br>These are some of the reasons why they are widely used in ML.<br>Pay attention to the difference between loss function and ROC/AUC, which is useful as a measure of how well the model can discriminate between two categories.<br>You may have two models with the same AUC but different losses.

                    <div>
                      Mean Square Error, as explained, would penalize higher errors.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Mean Absolute Error takes the absolute value of the difference between predictions and actual outcomes. So, it would not empathize higher errors.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                      Mean Bias Error takes just the value of the difference between predictions and actual outcomes. So, it compensates positive and negative differences between predicted/actual values. It is used to calculate the average bias in the model.

                      softmax is used in multi-class classification models which is clearly not suitable in the case of a binary-class logarithmic loss.

                      Cloud CDN is the service that caches and delivers static content from the closest locations (edge locations) to customers to accelerate web and mobile applications. This is a very important service for the Cloud but out of scope for MLOps.<br>MLOps covers all processes related to ML models; experimentation, preparation, testing, deployment and above all continuous integration and delivery.<br>The MLOps environment is designed to provide (some of) the following:

                  Deep Learning is known to give little comprehension about how a model works in detail.<br>Vertex Explainable AI helps to detect it, both for classification and regression tasks. So, these functions are useful for testing, tuning, finding biases and thus improving the process.<br>It uses three methods for feature attributions:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      sampled Shapley: Uses scores for each feature and their permutations

                    <li>
                      integrated gradients: computes the gradient of the features at different points, integrates them and computes the relative weights

                      In a recommendation system (like with the Netflix movies) it is important to discover similarities between products so that you may recommend a movie to another user because the different users like similar objects.<br>So, the problem is to find similar products as a first step.<br>You take two products and their characteristics (all transformed in numbers). So, you have two vectors.<br>You may compute differences between vectors in the euclidean space. Geometrically, that means that they have different lengths and different angles.

                  Google primarily recommends BigQuery, because this service allows you to efficiently perform both data and feature engineering operations with SQL standard.<br>In other words, it is suitable both to correct, divide and aggregate the data, and to process the features (fields) merging, normalizing and categorizing them in an easy way.<br>In order to transform data in advanced mode, for example, with window-aggregation feature transformations in streaming mode, the solution is Dataflow.<br>It is also possible to perform transformations on the data with Tensorflow (tf.transform), such as creating new features: crossed_column, embedding_column, bucketized_column.<br>It is important to note that with Tensorflow these transformations become part of the model and will be integrated into the graph that will be produced when the SavedModel is created.<br>Look at the summary table <a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/data-preprocessing-for-ml-with-tf-transform-pt1#preprocessing_options_summary">at this link</a> for a complete overview.

                      You lead a team of machine learning engineers working for an IoT startup. You need to create a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a device failure in manufacturing environments. The device generates a stream of metrics every 60 seconds. The metrics include 2 categorical values, 7 integer values, and 1 floating point value. The floating point value ranges from 0 to 100. For the purposes of the model, the floating point value is more precise than needed. Mapping that value to a feature with possible values "high", "medium", and "low" is sufficient. What feature engineering technique would you use to transform the floating point value to high, medium, or low?

                      You are an ML engineer with a startup building machine learning models for the pharmaceutical industry. You are currently developing a deep learning machine learning model to predict the toxicity of drug candidates. The training data set consists of a large number of chemical and physical attributes and there is a large number of instances. Training takes several days on an n2 type Compute Engine virtual machine. What would you recommend to reduce the training time without compromising the quality of the model?

                    <div>
                      TPUs are designed to accelerate the dominant computation in deep learning model training.

                    <div>
                      Using a smaller data set by sampling would reduce training time but would likely compromise the quality of the model.

                      You are building a machine learning model and during the data preparation stage, you preform normalization and standardization using the full data set. You then split the full data set into training, validation, and testing data sets. What problem could be introduced by performing the steps in the order described?

                      A team of machine learning engineers is training an image recognition model to detect defects in manufactured parts. The team has a data set of 10,000 images but wants to train with at least 30,000 images. They do not have time to wait for an additional set of 20,000 images to be collected on the factory floor. What type of technique could they use to produce a data set with 30,000 images?

                      When we start, science modeling will be our first choice since it builds the most accurate model based on science and natural laws.<br>For example, given the initial position and speed of an object, as well as its mass and the forces acting on it, we can precisely predict its position at any time. For this case, the mathematical model works much better than any ML model!

                      A real estate company, Zeellow, uses ML to forecast future sales by leveraging their historical data. Their data science team trained and deployed a DL model in production half a year ago. Recently, the model is suffering from performance issues due to data distribution changes.<br>The team is working on a strategy for model retraining. What is your suggestion?

                    <div>
                      Model retraining is based on data value skews, which are significant changes in the statistical properties of data.<br>When data skew is detected, this means that data patterns are changing, and we need to retrain the model to capture these changes.

                      Recent research has indicated that when a certain kind of cancer, X, is developed in a human liver, there are usually other symptoms that can be identified as objects Y and Z from CT scan images. A hospital is using this research to train ML models with a label map of (X, Y, Z) on CT images. What cost functions should be used in this case?

                      Categorical entropy is better to use when you want to prevent the model from giving more importance to a certain class – the same as the one-hot encoding idea.

                      A real estate company, Zeellow, uses ML to forecast future sales by leveraging their historical data. The recent model training was able to achieve the desired forecast accuracy objective, but it took the data science team a long time. They want to decrease the training time without affecting the achieved model accuracy. What hyperparameter should the team adjust?

                      The data science team has built a DNN model to monitor and detect defective products using the images from the assembly line of an automobile manufacturing company. As a Google ML Engineer, you need to measure the performance of the ML model for the test dataset/images. Which of the following would you choose?

                      It measures how well the predictions are ranked rather than their absolute values. It is a classification threshold invariant and thus is the best way to measure the model’s performance.

                      The data science team has built a DL model to monitor and detect defective products using the images from the assembly line of an automobile manufacturing company. Over time, the team has built multiple model versions in Vertex AI. As a Google ML Engineer, how will you compare the model versions?

                      It measures how well the different model versions perform over time: deploy your model as a model version and then create an evaluation job for that version. By comparing the mean average precision across the model versions, you can find the best performer.

                      Starbucks is an international coffee shop selling multiple products A, B, C… at different stores (1, 2, 3… using one-hot encoding and location binning). They are building stores and want to leverage ML models to predict product sales based on historical data (A1 is the data for product A sales at store 1). Following the best practices of splitting data into a training subset, validation subset, and testing subset, how should the data be distributed into these subsets?

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Training set: [A1, B2, F1, E2, ...]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Testing set: [A2, C3, D2, F4, ...]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Validation set: [B1, C1, D9, C2...]

                    <div>
                      If we distribute the data randomly into the training, validation, and test sets, the model will be able to learn specific qualities about the products.

                      If we divided things up at the product level so that the given products were only in the training subset, the validation subset, or the testing subset, the model would find it more difficult to get high accuracy on the validation since it would need to focus on the product characteristics/qualities

                      The data science team is building a DL model for a customer support center of a big ERP company, which has many ERP products and modules. The company receives over a million customer service calls every day and stores them in GCS. The call data must not leave the region in which the call originated and no PII can be stored/analyzed. The model will analyze calls for customer sentiments. How should you design a data pipeline for call processing, analyzing, and visualizing?

                      The data science team is building an ML model to monitor and detect defective products using the images from the assembly line of an automobile manufacturing company, which does not have reliable Wi-Fi near the assembly line. As a Google ML Engineer, you need to reduce the amount of time spent by quality control inspectors utilizing the model’s fast defect detection. Your company wants to implement the new ML model as soon as possible. Which model should you use?
